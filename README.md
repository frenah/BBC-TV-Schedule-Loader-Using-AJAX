# BBC-TV-Schedule-Loader-Using-AJAX

I made this using a codebar tutorial from the second part of a tutorial found here:
https://github.com/codebar/tutorials/blob/gh-pages/js/lesson4/tutorial.md

Loads tomorrow's TV schedule based on genre clicked. 
It collects the genres and TV schedule using json data that it collects through AJAX.
Please note that that when I first started playing with the json data it was down during parts of the day.
If you're getting errors please go to: http://www.bbc.co.uk/tv/programmes/genres.json
to see if it is online.

To use basically click a genre and have a wale of a time.
